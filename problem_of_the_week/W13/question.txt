Here's a plain and readable version of the given text:

In a game played on a pitch, players join one by one. At the start, the pitch is empty. There are three types of events in the game's timeline:

1. **x:** Player with number x joins the game. If x has already joined, ignore this event.

2. **-:** The player who has spent the most time on the pitch goes to the bench. If no such player exists, ignore this event.

3. **+:** The player who has spent the least time on the bench returns to the pitch. If no such player exists, ignore this event.

At the beginning, both the pitch and the bench are empty. Given the timeline, print the player numbers currently in the pitch, sorted in increasing order by the time they spent on the pitch. When a player goes to the bench, their time on the pitch is reset to 0.

**Input Format:**
The first line contains an integer q — the number of events.
The next q lines contain space-separated events, each being x, +, or -.

**Output Format:**
Space-separated player numbers x, representing players in the pitch, sorted by the time they spent on the pitch.

**Constraints:**
- 0 ≤ q ≤ 2 × 10^5
- 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 × 10^9

**Sample Input 1:**
```
11
1 3 5 - 1 4 - 5 6 + +
```

**Sample Output 1:**
```
1 3 6 4 5
```

**Explanation 1:**
1. Player 1 joins the game.
2. Player 3 joins the game.
3. Player 5 joins the game.
4. Player 1 goes to the bench.
5. Player 1 is already in the game, so this event is ignored.
6. Player 4 joins the game.
7. Player 3 goes to the bench.
8. Player 5 is already in the game, so this event is ignored.
9. Player 6 joins the game.
10. Player 3 returns to the pitch.
11. Players 1 and 5 return to the pitch.
