Napoleon Bonaparte, also known as Napoleon I, was a significant French leader. He gained prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns in the Revolutionary Wars.

After Napoleon's wars, he strategically grew his army at specific times. However, following defeats in later conflicts, his army size decreased. With access to a historical document detailing the initial soldier count and subsequent changes year by year, you have a unique opportunity. You can use a single-use time machine to rectify past mistakes by nullifying a military change for a specific year. The goal is to achieve the maximum historical troop count, not necessarily the highest count Napoleon ever reached.

Note: The provided dates and military changes are fictional and do not relate to actual historical events.

Input Format:
The first line provides values for the total number of years (n) and the initial number of soldiers (k). Following that, there are n lines containing pairs of year (y) and the corresponding change in the military count (c).

Output Format:
Determine the maximum number of soldiers Napoleon could have reached.

Constraints:
- Number of years ranges from 1 to 500.
- Initial soldier count varies from 0 to 1,000,000.
- Changes in soldier count range from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.
- The soldier count remains positive throughout every year.

Sample Input 1:
10 24
1803 +20
1805 +29
1807 -7
1808 +30
1812 -3
1814 +7
1816 +23
1820 -11
1821 +21
1825 +3

Sample Output 1:
147

Explanation 1:
By preventing the change in 1820, a maximum count of 147 soldiers could be reached.

Sample Input 2:
10 12
1804 +15
1806 -12
1807 +23
1809 +19
1811 +21
1815 +18
1817 -22
1820 -19
1823 +30
1824 -14

Sample Output 2:
108

Explanation 2:
Blocking the change in 1806 would result in achieving the maximum count of 108 soldiers.
