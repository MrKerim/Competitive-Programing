# Competitive-Programing  

This repo contains competitive programming problem solutions mostly solved in CPP.
Most of the questions are taken from the algoleague and created by inzva.
The repo also shows the programs of the inzva that I have participated in before.

Here is a simple guide through all the main files:
2023 Summer Camp - June 2023 / June
This was my first real-time experience with both inzva and competitive programming.
This repo mostly consists of the basic algorithms and their solutions.
The repo is really messy. This is because there are a lot of other projects that I was working on too.

2023 Algorithm Program - September 2023 / November 
This is another inzva algorithm event however there is a key difference between the two repos.
I participated as an advanced member of this event. This means that my algorithm skills were highly improved.
I have been studying since the middle of summer and have been learning the past algorithms again and keeping them ready to use,
by solving problems left from the summer camp and in algoleague, a leet-code a like competitive programming site created by inzva, 

This repo mostly consists of advanced algorithms like segment-tree, graph traversals, cycle detection, trie, and dp problems.
Every week starting from the first is labelled and the notes from the lectures and the solutions to the questions are separate.
The questions are not clarified in the solutions. This is because most of the questions are in the problem sets which are only visible to the participants.
While anyone can be a participant in some questions. Some are not visible to others without directly accessing through the link and registering.

Problem Of The Week - September 2023 / ?
As the name states, this is a problem list that consists of new problems every week on algoleague.
There are only solutions now, I might also add the problem statements from now on.
