Task: Harun taught Mr. Atakan about data structures, but now Mr. Atakan needs your help to solve this task involving two types of queries:

Add a number, denoted as x, to a list.
Print the maximum number in the list and then remove this number. If the list is empty, print -1.

Input Format:
The first line contains N — the number of queries.
Each of the next N lines of each test case is in one of two forms:

1 x — add number x to the list.
2 — Print the maximum number in the list and then remove this number. If the list is empty, print -1.

Output Format:
For each test case, output the answers of queries of the second type, in the order they are given.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 3 × 10^5
- 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
