In the land of Inzvaland, a variant of Quidditch is played. Each person has their own bludger, each with a unique weight. These bludgers move at the same speed either to the Right (R) or Left (L). To play Inzva Quidditch, all bludgers are arranged in a line. When the game begins, each bludger moves in its direction (R or L). If a bludger collides with a heavier one, it gets destroyed, while the heavier one continues its journey. The task is to find the number of bludgers that remain undestroyed.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'n' — the number of bludgers.
The second line contains 'n' integers 'w1, w2, w3, ..., wn' — the weights of each bludger.
The third line contains 'n' characters, each being either 'R' or 'L' — the direction of each bludger.

Output Format:
Print the count of bludgers that remain undestroyed.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ wi ≤ 2 × 10^5

Sample Input 1:
3
3 4 5
R R L

Sample Output 1:
1

Explanation 1:
Bludger 3 (weight 5) hits bludger 2 (weight 4) first and destroys it.
Then bludger 3 (weight 5) hits bludger 1 (weight 3) and destroys it too.
Finally, bludger 3 is the only one left undestroyed as there are no more bludgers to collide with.
