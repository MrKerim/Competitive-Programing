In the city of Melihistan, there's a new way to calculate charges for natural gas usage. Instead of a traditional billing system, they've introduced a unique method. Here's how it works:

When you use a certain amount of gas (measured in cubic meters) in a month, you'll be charged a specific amount based on that usage.

The rule for calculating the charge is determined by a function called 
f(x). This function counts how many numbers, less than or equal to the amount of gas used (x), can be expressed as the sum of two non-negative powers of 2.

For example, let's say you used 5 cubic meters of gas. Now, according to the rule, the charge for this usage would be 4 liras. This is because there are 4 numbers that fit the rule: 2 (1 + 1), 3 (2 + 1), 4 (2 + 2), and 5 (4 + 1).

Your task is to find the charge for the gas usage based on this unique billing system.

Input:

The first line contains a number 
Q
Q, which represents the number of queries.
Following that, each line contains a number 
X
X, indicating the gas usage for each query.
Output:

For each query, output the charge calculated using the function f(x).
Constraints:


Q (number of queries) ranges from 1 to 200,000.
X (gas usage) ranges from 1 to 1,000,000,000.
For instance, if the input is:

Sample input
2
5
8

Sample Output
4
6
This means that for the first query (gas usage = 5), the charge is 4 liras, and for the second query (gas usage = 8), the charge is 6 liras, based on the given function.
