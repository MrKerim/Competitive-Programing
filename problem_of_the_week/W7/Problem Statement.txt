Morgana, an exceptional algorithm lecturer, intends to distribute magical pots among participants in an Algorithm Program.

Considerations:

Morgana can allocate at most one magical pot to each participant.
Each participant 'i' has a magic tolerance level 'm[i]'. This level indicates the minimum required magic for satisfaction.
Each magical pot 'j' has a magic level 'p[j]'. If 'p[j] ≥ m[i]', the pot 'j' can be assigned to participant 'i', thereby satisfying them.
Objective:

The goal is to maximize the count of happy participants and determine the maximum achievable number.

Input Format:

The first line: Number of participants (M).
The second line: Number of magical pots (P).
The third line: Magic tolerances for 'M' participants.
The fourth line: Magic levels for 'P' pots.
Output Format:

Output the count of satisfied participants.
Constraints:

1 ≤ M ≤ 3 * 10^4
0 ≤ P ≤ 3 * 10^4
1 ≤ m[i], p[j] ≤ 2^31 - 1
This format should make the provided information more structured and easier to comprehend.
