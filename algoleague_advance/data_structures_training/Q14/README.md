A palindrome string is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards as backward. Given a string containing only uppercase letters from the Latin alphabet, your challenge is to rearrange its characters to form a palindrome. If multiple palindromes exist, please choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Input Format
- The first line contains $N$ — the length of the string.
- The second line contains the string. The string consists of only uppercase letters from the Latin alphabet.

### Output Format
- Output a palindrome lexicographically smallest one. In case there are no solutions, print `NO SOLUTION`.

### Constraints
- $1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6$

### Sample Input 1 
3  
1 2 1
### Sample Output 1
2 -1 2
