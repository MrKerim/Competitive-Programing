[See the question in LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/submissions/1498963329/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=breadth-first-search)

Can you solve this real interview question? Same Tree - Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:

</p>



Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true


Example 2:


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg" alt="image" >
</p>



Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false


Example 3:

</p>



Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false


 

Constraints:

 * The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
 * -104 <= Node.val <= 104
